# PCS3

This is a homework repository for the PCS3 (Module 3/4) for Programming C# at Fontys University in Eindhoven.

Purpose of this repository is to serve as a personal log and storage for course material and to also allow future re-visiting and review of written code to see progress over time.

## Disclaimer
This module was done quite urgently as access to the course late into the educational block (Week 4 / 6). As a result of this the code is rather subpar and will be re-written in review at a later date.
